Describe a situation where an inference and a prediction could be made from the same data.

 
Predicting the behavior of financial markets days before, during and after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings

FOMC is a branch of the Federal Reserve System responsible for setting the countryâ€™s monetary policy, in particular interest rates. The committee is composed of the seven members of the Board of Governors and five Federal Reserve Bank presidents who meet 8 times a year to discuss if there should be any changes to the near-term monetary policy.

Prior to the FOMC meeting, Wall Street and Financial Institutions make predictions as to whether the interest rates will be cut, maintained/held steady or increased. The predictions are primarily made based on inference on economic growth measured by changes in quarterly GDP as well as on monthly changes in inflation measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) for the previous months or years.

A few days prior to the FOMC meetings, the predictions made by financial institutions heighten uncertainty and volatility in the stock markets which often induce panic selling of assets by investors.

 

Why would your inference and prediction be correct?

Given that FOMC meetings occur regularly to make decisions on interest rates, any hints on lowering interest rates (relaxing monetary policy) may result in an increase in stock prices. Same reaction may be observed when the interest rates are held steady/maintained. However, if the Feds decide to raise interest rates (tightening monetary policy) during the FOMC meeting due to increasing inflation, more selling of stocks ensure resulting in lower stock prices.

 

What are the weaknesses of your inference and prediction?

One cannot predict with accuracy how the markets will react following the FOMC meeting. The market may change from trading one sector/industrial group or category of stocks to another (e.g. go into defensive stocks or from large to small capitalization stocks) following the meeting regardless of the monetary policy decision.

 

What data would make it a more precise inference or prediction?

Retrospective data on stocks activity as well as economic data on CPI, PCE, yields/bonds and GDP. For instance data for the years 2007 through 2009 when we had the last recession.

 

What would be the dangers of decision-making based on your inference and prediction? 

 "All models are wrong, but some are useful" -  George E. P. Box

In the real world there will never be an exact linear relationship or an exact normal distribution hence models have to be used with caution and routinely validated or quality controlled/audited.
